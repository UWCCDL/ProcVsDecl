# Behavioral Results

In the new analysis, individuals best-fit by the Declarative model show significant behavioral differences when compared to individuals best-fit by the Procedural model.  These differences are apparent in both behaviroal and task fMRI data.

## Behavioral Differences

Procedural and Declarative participants differ in:

1. The probability of changing response from trial to trial
