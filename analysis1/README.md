# Analysis 1

This analysis essentially applies the new new, trial-by-trial log-likelihood methods to the original data in Cher Yang's [BioarXiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.10.523458v1.abstract).

In that dataset, the first response of every trial was excluded because it was not possible to compute a "response switch" metric, which was essential for the aggregate model optimization procedure.

The second analysis in this repository extends the method to all of the trials in the data.
